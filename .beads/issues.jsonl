Sound may not be playing\n3. Notifications don't 'toast' prominently - they hide in notification center\n\nInvestigate:\n- Verify the shell expansion in the hook command works\n- Confirm sound is actually playing via mac-notification-sys\n- Research if we can programmatically request 'Alert' style instead of 'Banner'\n- Consider alternative notification approaches if needed (e.g., alerter, terminal-notifier with -sound)\n\nGoal: Notifications should be unmissable when Claude Code finishes a task.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:32:42.112209-05:00","created_by":"robert.roskam","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:41:55.119173-05:00"}
